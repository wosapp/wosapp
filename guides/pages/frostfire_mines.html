  <summary>How to collect Orichalcum points</summary>
There are three main ways to collect Orichalcum points during the Frostfire Mines event:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Orichalcum Veins:</strong> these mines are scattered around the map and can be captured by players. Each mine provides a steady stream of Orichalcum points while it is under your control.
    Level 1, 2 and 3 veins are available and provide 8, 16 and 32 Orichalcum points every second of occupation (up to 8,640, 17,280 and 34,560 respectively).
    The map is divided in three sections, with the level 3 veins located in the third level around the center of the map.
  </li>
    <li><strong>Veins Outburst:</strong> these are temporary locations that spawn during the event. 
      Players can gather Orichalcum points from these deposits, base gathering rate is 200/s with a maximum of 4,000.</li>
    <li><strong>Smelter occupation time:</strong> located at the center of the map, the Smelter gives points based on the total occupation time ranking:
      <ul>
        <li>1: 100,000 points</li>
        <li>2: 80,000 points</li>
        <li>3: 60,000 points</li>
        <li>4: 55,000 points</li>
        <li>5: 50,000 points</li>
        <li>6: 40,000 points</li>
        <li>7: 35,000 points</li>
        <li>8: 30,000 points</li>
        <li>9: 25,000 points</li>
        <li>10: 20,000 points</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

<p>Most of the damage is dealt by Marksmen and Lancers, while Infantry contributes marginally. Preset your marches accordingly, prioritizing Marksmen, followed by Lancers and finally Infantry.</p>
<p>In orderd to prepare your marches in advance, calculate the maximum deployable troops for your marches:
  <ul>
    <li>If your total troops do not exceed the maximum deployable troops you can simply equalize all your marches</li>
    <li>If your troops exceed the maximum deployable troops: split Marksmen and Lancers among the available marches, then fill the rest with infantry. 
      Note that if you lead a rally you have an extra march available. For example if you can deploy 6 marches and you are a rally starter, your total marches is 7.</li>
    <li>If you are a strong rally leader, consider setting your rally with 1 infantry, 20% lancers and 80% marksmen (only if you have at least 25-30% of marksmen in the other marches to join other players rallies)</li>
  </ul>
