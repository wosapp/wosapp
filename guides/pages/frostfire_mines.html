  <summary>How to collect Orichalcum points</summary>
  <p>There are three main ways to collect Orichalcum points during the Frostfire Mines event:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Orichalcum Veins:</strong> these mines are scattered around the map and can be occupied by players. Each mine provides a steady stream of Orichalcum points while it is under your control.
    Level 1, 2 and 3 veins are available and provide 8, 16 and 32 Orichalcum points every second of occupation (up to 8,640, 17,280 and 34,560 respectively).
    The map is divided in three sections, with the level 3 veins located in the third level around the center of the map.
  </li>
    <li><strong>Veins Outburst:</strong> these are temporary veins that spawn during the event. 
      Players can gather Orichalcum points from these deposits, base gathering rate is 200/s with a maximum of 4,000.</li>
    <li><strong>Smelter occupation time:</strong> located at the center of the map, the Smelter gives points based on the total occupation time ranking:
      <ul>
        <li>1: 100,000 points</li>
        <li>2: 80,000 points</li>
        <li>3: 60,000 points</li>
        <li>4: 55,000 points</li>
        <li>5: 50,000 points</li>
        <li>6: 40,000 points</li>
        <li>7: 35,000 points</li>
        <li>8: 30,000 points</li>
        <li>9: 25,000 points</li>
        <li>10: 20,000 points</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>There are few other ways to earn points which, however, depend on the skills you learn during the event. 
     More details are explained in the "Strategy and Gameplay" section below</p>

<details class="expand-box">
  <summary>Battle Phases</summary>
  <p>During this event you have infinite troops and you cannot attack other players cities. However, you can attack occupied veins. If you lose an attack (or a defense), the heroes will die and cannot be used for 5 minutes. 
    It is important to recall your marches if you are under attacks and you think you will lose the defense, as well as avoid attacking players stronger than you and whales.
    In case you win a defense your troops will heal automatically and there is no need to send more.</p>
  <p>The Frostfire Mines event is divided in three phases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Preparation Phase:</strong> when the battlefield opens you you will have three minutes to scout the map and find a spot where you want to teleport and play.</li>
    <li><strong>Battle Phase:</strong> the main battle phase where players can capture veins, defeat patrols and gather Orichalcum points. 
    During this phase Outburst veins span in two different occasions: at 20:00 and 10:00 minute marks. On both occasions, Outbursts spawn three times one with a one minute interval (20/19/18 and 10/9/8).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Final Phase:</strong> the battle for the Smelter begins. During this phase you can either continue farming as you have been doing the entire event, or teleport to the center of the map and fight to control the Smelter.</li>
</details>
  
<details class="expand-box">
  <summary>Strategy and gameplay</summary>
<p>There are different strategies to play this event, and it depends whether you are a free-to-play (or low spender) or a whale.
<ol>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">During the 3 minutes preparation phase you want to find a spont on the map where you will teleport. In general, you should find a place where there are 4-5 veins close to each other, as well as some Patrol guards in teh surrounding area
      If you are a whale you should aim at level 3 veins close to the center of the map, while low spenders and F2P should aim at level 2 or level 1 veins depending on your power.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">When the battle begins teleport to the chosen location right beside a Orichalcum vein.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Start attacking Patrol guards, and try to unlock skills as soon as possible.
    However, if other players are doing the same, start gathering from the veins right away.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">It is fundamental to optimize the time available, never keep marches inactive in your city or send them to patrol guards other players are farming. 
    For example, if there are not enough patrol guards in the beginning, start collecting from 3 (or 4) veins and use the remaining marches to attack the patrol guards.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Use speed ups if other players are attacking the same Patrol guard.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">As soon as you unlock the third skill, recall the closes march and send it out again. 
    Look at the time and keep doing this every minute, you will earn 5000 extra points every time you do it.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">You will be notified when the Outburst veins spawn, so make sure to recall your marches 20-30 seconds before they spawn. 
      Send marches to them as soon as possible. Each Outburst you capture will give you 4000 points.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">If you are a whale, when the smelter opens, teleport to the center, activate your level 5 skill and start fighting for it. Use speed ups to get the first control, even if only for 1s will make the difference. Meanwhile, keep farming veins with your marches.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">If you are a low spender or F2P, activate your left skill every time it is not on cooldown and when the smelter opens continue farming veins.
  </li>
</ol>
